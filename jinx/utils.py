"""Utility helpers.

This module exposes a small set of utilities used across async flows. The
primary export is ``chaos_patch``, an async context manager that patches
``stdout`` to cooperate with ``prompt_toolkit`` rendering. This avoids output
interleaving artifacts when concurrently reading user input and printing logs.
