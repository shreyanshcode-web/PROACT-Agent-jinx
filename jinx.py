"""Agent entrypoint.

This module serves as the CLI bootstrap for the Jinx agent runtime. It
delegates orchestration to ``jinx.orchestrator.main()`` and provides a thin
exception boundary suitable for production usage.

Design goals
------------
* Keep the entrypoint minimal and dependency-light.
* Provide predictable behavior on interrupts.
* Ensure non-zero exit codes on unexpected exceptions.
